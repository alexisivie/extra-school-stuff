## Lab 02

### Description
In this lab, I learned how to use the Linux command line. I practiced basic commands, moved around folders, and edited files using a text editor in the terminal. I also tried shortcuts and completed a challenge to test what I learned. This lab helped me get comfortable looking for files in the terminal instead of a GUI. I also gained experience looking up solutions online.
